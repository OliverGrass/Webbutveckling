  There's much written on www about the history of the internet. For example, about the first graphical Internet browser on
  the web.
  <blockquote>NCSA Mosaic 1.0Mosaic is the first widely used graphical World Wide Web browser developed and first released on April 22,
    1993 by the NCSA with the help of Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina. A big competitor to Mosaic was Netscape, which was released
    a year later.</blockquote>
  <q>Today's Internet browsers we use today, e.g. Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, etc., got their inspiration from the Mosaic
    browser.
