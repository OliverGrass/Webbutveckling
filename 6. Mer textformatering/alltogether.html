  <br> What is
  <i>JavaScript?</i>
  <br>
  <i>JavaScript</i> is a powerful scripting language created by Netscape,
  <del>and is supported by Netscape 2.0 and higher, and Explorer 4.0 and higher.</del> It is primarily used to add interactivity
  and multimedia to web pages.
  <ins>Beside the name,
    <mark>
      <i>Javascript</i> has nothing to do with the Java programming language.</mark> The fact that the names are similar to
    each other has led to some confusion.</ins>

  <br> There's much written on www about the history of the internet. For example, about the first graphical Internet browser
  on the web.
  <blockquote>NCSA Mosaic 1.0Mosaic is the first widely used graphical World Wide Web browser developed and first released on April 22,
    1993 by the NCSA with the help of Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina. A big competitor to Mosaic was Netscape, which was released
    a year later.</blockquote>
  <q>Today's Internet browsers we use today, e.g. Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, etc., got their inspiration from the Mosaic
    browser.
