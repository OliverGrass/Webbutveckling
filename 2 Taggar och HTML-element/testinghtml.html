The default language for writing HTML is english.<br>
HTML is used to select parts of a text.<br>
Using these selections, the text can be formatted in different ways, much like a 
word processor.<br><br><!-- linebreaks -->

Linebreaks of empty lines in your code deditors are not carried over to the web
page. There are three sentences, each on a separate line, in your code editor.
On the web page these sentences are shown directly after each other. To get a
linebreak after each sentence on the web page the &lt;br&gt;-tag have to be used.

<!-- Comments in HTML is done like this. Comments are used for explaining
something for other coders. Comments will not show up in your web page. -->
