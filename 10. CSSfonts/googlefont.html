  <h1>Fonts from Google</h1>
  <div class="one">
    <b>Roboto, sans-serif;</b>
    <p>Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font
      features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesnâ€™t
      compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more
      commonly found in humanist and serif types.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="two">
    <b>Oswald, sans-serif;</b>
    <p>Vernon practiced typeface design from 2007 to 2014. A lifelong artist, during this time he eagerly explored designing
      type for the cloud-based era. His work spans all genres, from lively script faces to workhorse text families and operating
      system UI. Vernon graduated with an MA in Typeface Design from the University of Reading and lives in California. His
      designs are mostly published as open source Google Fonts and his favorite projects include Oxygen Mono, Monda, and
      Bowlby One.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="three">
    <b>Indie Flower, cursive;</b>
    <p>This handwriting font feels carefree and open to me with the bubbly, rounded edges. It is easy to read and a bit bolder
      than some of my other fonts.</p>
